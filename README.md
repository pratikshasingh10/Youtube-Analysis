# Youtube-Analysis-Project
## Overview
The YouTube Analysis Project is designed to provide comprehensive insights into the performance of a YouTube channel by analyzing key metrics such as views, likes, comments, and subscriber growth. This project utilizes Python for data analysis and visualization to uncover patterns in audience engagement and content performance, enabling data-driven decisions to optimize channel strategy and growth.
## Objectives
- To analyze key performance metrics such as views, likes, comments, and subscriber growth.
- To identify trends and patterns in audience engagement and content performance over time.
- To explore the impact of factors like video length, upload frequency, and posting times on channel performance.
## Project Components
### 1. Data Import and Preparation
- Load necessary Python libraries (pandas, seaborn).
- Import the YouTube dataset into the Jupyter Notebook.
### 2. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
- Convert data types and normalize data for consistency.
- Feature extraction and engineering to create new variables for analysis.
### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Visualize key metrics like views, likes, comments, and subscriber growth using bar charts, histograms, and line plots.
- Identify correlations between variables to understand their impact on engagement and performance.
## Dataset
The dataset used in this project was obtained through YouTube's API and contains detailed information on video performance, including:

- Video ID
- View count
- Like count
- Comment count
- Subscriber growth
- Upload date and time
